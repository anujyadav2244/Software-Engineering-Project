Q. What is Asynchronous and Synchronous Programming.

-> Synchronous programming means it will use a  single - thread, so only one operation or program will run at a time.

Sync is blocking - it will only send the server one request at a time wait for that request to be answered by the server.

Asynchronous programming is non - blocking , which means it will handle multiple request  at a time.

Async increases throughout because multiple operations can run at the same time.
