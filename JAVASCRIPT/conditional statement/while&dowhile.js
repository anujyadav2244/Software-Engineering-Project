//A while loop evaluate the condition inside the parenthesis().
//If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the while loop is executed.
//The condition is evaluated again.
//This process continues until the condition gets false.
//When the condition evaluates to false, the loop stops.

// we have to print 1 to 10 using the while loop
// var num = 1;
// while(num<=10){
//     console.log(num)
//     num++
// }

//DO-while loop - 
var a = 1
do{
    console.log(a)
    a++
}while(a<=10)
